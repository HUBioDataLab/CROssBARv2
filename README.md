# CROssBAR-BioCypher-Migration
This is a repo for migration of [CROssBAR](https://github.com/cansyl/CROssBAR) data to the Neo4j database via [BioCypher](https://github.com/saezlab/BioCypher)

## Installation
The project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org). You can install like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/HUBioDataLab/CROssBAR-BioCypher-Migration.git

Poetry will create a virtual environment according to your configuration (either centrally or in the project folder). You can activate it by running `poetry shell` inside the project directory.
